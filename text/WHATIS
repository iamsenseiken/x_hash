			*WHAT IS X_HASH ????*
			*********************

	X_HASH is a collection of two libraries, X_List and X_Hash. 

	You will need a ANSI C compiler or a C++ compiler.


	1) X_List is a stand-alone library for C and C++ that will
	   allow for the simple, efficient management of doubly linked
	   lists of pointers in a logical form. This is one of the most
	   often used programming constructs.

	2) X_Hash allows for a list of pointers to be stored by a 
	   key value. A function is provided to turn a text string into
	   this key value. Thus, a pointer may be stored much like in a
	   database.

	   X_Hash needs X_List available to operate.

	3) DOCUMENTATION is on the way, for now, the sample "test" programs
	   should get you started, mail me any questions!
